**Global Dairy-Free Spreads Market Status (2017-2022)**

**Impact of COVID-19**

The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial effect on the dairy-free spreads market, with both positive and negative impacts. Early in the pandemic, many consumers shifted toward home cooking and baking, leading to an increase in demand for products like dairy-free butter and plant-based spreads. At the same time, disruptions in the global supply chain affected the production and distribution of many food products, including dairy-free alternatives.

Consumers increasingly sought products that were not only healthier but also aligned with ethical and environmental values. This shift toward plant-based eating was fueled by a combination of health concerns, a desire for weight management, and environmental sustainability.
