**Market Segmentation**

**1. By Type**

The **BCI market** can be categorized into different types based on the method of interaction between the brain and the device.

- **Invasive BCI**
  Invasive BCIs involve the implantation of electrodes directly into the brain tissue. These devices provide high-quality signals and have applications primarily in medical treatments, such as treating patients with severe neurological conditions. However, invasive BCIs require surgery, which limits their widespread adoption.
- **Non-Invasive BCI**
  Non-invasive BCIs do not require surgery and rely on external sensors to detect brain activity. Technologies like Electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are commonly used in non-invasive BCIs. These devices are less risky and are often used in applications like gaming, neurofeedback, and cognitive training.
- **Partially Invasive BCI**
  Partially invasive BCIs lie between invasive and non-invasive BCIs, involving the placement of sensors inside the skull but not directly in the brain tissue. These devices offer a compromise between signal quality and patient safety, with applications in both medical and non-medical sectors.

**2. By Component**

The **BCI market** is segmented based on the various components that make up a Brain-Computer Interface system.

- **Hardware**
  Hardware components include electrodes, amplifiers, sensors, and signal processing units. These components are essential for capturing and transmitting brain signals to external devices. Hardware also includes the interface device, which is the physical system interacting with the brain signal.
- **Software**
  Software plays a crucial role in decoding the brain signals and converting them into actionable outputs. This includes algorithms for signal processing, machine learning for enhancing accuracy, and user interface software for communication with external devices.
- **Other Components**
  Other components include the communication equipment (such as wireless transmitters and receivers) that enable connectivity between the BCI and external devices.

**3. By Technology**

Technological advancements in BCIs have expanded their use across several sectors. The market is divided based on the core technologies that drive these interfaces.

- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**
  EEG is one of the most commonly used techniques in non-invasive BCIs. It involves measuring electrical activity on the scalp, which is then translated into signals that can control external devices. EEG is commonly used in applications such as gaming, healthcare, and neurofeedback.
- **Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)**
  fNIRS uses infrared light to measure brain activity. It is gaining popularity due to its non-invasive nature and ease of use. fNIRS is mostly employed in research and clinical applications.
- **Magnetoencephalography (MEG)**
  MEG is a technique used to measure the magnetic fields generated by neuronal activity in the brain. It offers higher spatial resolution compared to EEG and is used for scientific research and medical applications.
- **Other Technologies**
  Other emerging technologies in BCIs include electrocorticography (ECoG) and implanted brain electrodes that measure electrical activity at the cortical level.

**4. By Connectivity**

Connectivity refers to how BCIs transmit the brain signals to external devices.

- **Wired Connectivity**
  Wired BCIs use cables to transmit brain signals to external devices. Although they can offer stable and high-quality signals, they are less convenient due to the limitations of cables and mobility.
- **Wireless Connectivity**
  Wireless BCIs use technologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other radio-frequency communication systems to transmit data. Wireless BCIs offer greater convenience and mobility, making them more suitable for consumer applications like gaming and mental wellness.
