**Animal Type Segmentation**

The market is categorized into various animal types:

- **Cattle**: Dominated the market with a share of 53.5% in 2023. Cattle are highly susceptible to FMD, and outbreaks can lead to significant economic losses due to reduced milk production and productivity. The demand for cattle products in both developed and developing countries is driving the need for effective vaccination programs.
- **Swine**: Expected to grow at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The rising demand for pork as a source of protein and income in many developing countries is contributing to the increased adoption of FMD vaccines in swine populations.
- **Sheep and Goat**: While these animals represent a smaller segment, they are crucial in regions where small-scale farming is prevalent. Vaccination efforts are essential to prevent FMD outbreaks that can affect these populations.
- **Others**: Includes wildlife species such as bison and antelope, which are also susceptible to FMD. Conservation efforts and awareness programs are being implemented to protect these endangered species from the disease.

**Vaccine Type Segmentation**

The market is segmented based on vaccine types:

- **Inactivated (Killed) Vaccines**: Held a market share of 53.0% in 2023. These vaccines are preferred due to their high efficacy, safety, longer duration of immunity, and regulatory approval. They are widely used in both routine and emergency vaccination programs.
- **Modified/Attenuated Live Vaccines**: Expected to grow at a significant CAGR during the forecast period. These vaccines offer strong immune responses and cost-effectiveness, making them a preferred choice in many regions. Increased funding and initiatives to improve livestock health are further driving the growth of this segment.
- **Emergency Vaccines**: Used during outbreaks to control the spread of the disease. These vaccines are critical in regions with frequent FMD occurrences and are often supported by government initiatives.

**Distribution Channel Segmentation**

The market is analyzed based on distribution channels:
