**1. Market Segmentation**

**A. By Type**

1. **Stretch Sleeve Labels**
   Stretch sleeve labels are designed to be stretched over products during application. These labels are highly durable, resistant to scratches, and provide an excellent surface for printing. Stretch sleeve labels are primarily used in beverage packaging, particularly on bottles and cans, due to their ability to conform to the shape of the container.
1. **Shrink Sleeve Labels**
   Shrink sleeve labels are applied to products using heat. These labels shrink tightly to the contours of the product, offering a high-quality, seamless finish. Shrink sleeves are commonly used for packaging in the food and beverage, pharmaceutical, and personal care sectors. They are also popular for their ability to offer tamper-evident solutions.
