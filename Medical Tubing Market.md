- **Coiled Tubing**
  Coiled tubing is used in applications where flexibility and the ability to navigate through complex pathways are required. It is used for catheters, endoscopes, and certain types of surgical drains.
- **Braided Tubing**
  Braided tubing is reinforced with woven fibers to increase strength and pressure resistance. It is used in high-pressure applications such as in IV systems and catheter systems where durability is essential.
- **Single-Lumen and Multi-Lumen Tubing**
  Single-lumen tubing has a single channel for fluid flow, while multi-lumen tubing has multiple channels, allowing for simultaneous delivery of different fluids or medications. Multi-lumen tubes are widely used in specialized catheter and IV applications.
- **Reinforced Tubing**
  Reinforced tubing contains a layer of reinforcement, such as metal or polymer strands, to provide additional strength and prevent kinking. It is typically used in applications like high-pressure infusion systems or surgical drains.

**4. By Processing Technique**

The processing technique used to manufacture medical tubing significantly impacts the performance and application of the final product.

- **Extrusion**
  Extrusion is the most common technique used to manufacture medical tubing. The raw material is heated and forced through a die to form a tube with a consistent cross-sectional profile. This method is commonly used for most types of medical tubing.
- **Blow Molding**
  Blow molding is used to create hollow tubes and is particularly useful for applications like infusion pumps and catheters. It allows for greater precision and customization of tube designs.
- **Co-Extrusion**
  Co-extrusion involves layering two or more materials together to form a single tube. This method is used to create tubing with specialized properties, such as enhanced durability or biocompatibility.
- **Dip Coating**
  Dip coating is a process in which a mold is dipped into a coating material to form a layer of tubing. This method is used for producing specialized coatings or textures on medical tubing.
