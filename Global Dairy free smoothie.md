**Impact of COVID-19**

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the dairy-free smoothie market, both positively and negatively. Initially, the pandemic disrupted the supply chain and caused store closures, limiting access to fresh ingredients and finished smoothie products. However, as consumers became more focused on health and wellness, the demand for dairy-free smoothies surged.
