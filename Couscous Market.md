**Challenges**

- **Competition from Alternative Grains**
  Couscous faces increasing competition from other grains, such as quinoa, bulgur, and rice, which offer similar health benefits and are also gaining popularity as alternative staples. These alternatives are particularly appealing to consumers seeking gluten-free options or a more diverse range of grains in their diets.
- **Price Fluctuations in Raw Materials**
  The price of wheat, the primary raw material for couscous production, can fluctuate due to factors such as climate change, crop yields, and geopolitical instability. These price fluctuations can impact the cost of couscous production and, in turn, its retail price.
- **Consumer Education**
  While couscous has gained popularity, there are still regions and demographics where awareness of the product remains low. Consumer education efforts to promote couscous’s nutritional benefits and culinary versatility will be key in driving future growth.

**Conclusion**

The global couscous market is experiencing steady growth, with key drivers including rising health-consciousness, the increasing popularity of ethnic cuisines, and the demand for convenient and quick meal solutions.
