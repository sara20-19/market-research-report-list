**Global Dark Beer Market Status (2017-2022)**

**Impact of COVID-19**

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced the dark beer market. Initially, during lockdowns and restrictions, the market witnessed a slump in on-premise consumption (bars, pubs, and restaurants). However, off-premise sales surged, particularly in supermarkets, retail stores, and through online platforms, as consumers turned to home drinking experiences. This shift prompted dark beer manufacturers to enhance their e-commerce strategies, making it easier for consumers to access their favorite brews from home.

The pandemic also accelerated the growth of craft beers, as more consumers explored unique beer options. Additionally, some beer lovers became more experimental in their tastes, opting for darker, richer beer varieties, including stouts, porters, and bocks.

By 2021, as the pandemic began to recede in many regions, the market witnessed a recovery. The increasing demand for premium, craft, and artisanal dark beers became apparent, further bolstered by a shift in consumer habits and preferences towards higher-quality products.
