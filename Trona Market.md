**2. Market Segmentation**

**A. By Type**

- **Natural Trona**
  Mined directly from trona deposits, mainly in the U.S., Turkey, and parts of Africa. Offers high purity and lower processing costs compared to synthetic alternatives.
- **Synthetic Trona (or Synthetic Soda Ash)**
  Produced chemically, often as a substitute when natural trona sources are unavailable. However, it typically has a higher environmental footprint.
