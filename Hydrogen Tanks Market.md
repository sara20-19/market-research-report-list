**Market Segmentation**

**By Tank Type**

- **Type I (Metallic Tanks)**
  These tanks are made of steel and are widely used for low-pressure storage. They are durable and cost-effective for various applications but are heavier than other tank types.
- **Type II (Metallic-Wrapped Tanks)**
  These are made of metal with composite wrapping, offering a balance of strength, weight, and cost efficiency. They are commonly used for medium-pressure hydrogen storage.
- **Type III (Composite-Wrapped Tanks)**
  Made with aluminum or other metals and wrapped with composite materials, Type III tanks are lightweight and ideal for high-pressure storage of hydrogen, providing improved safety and efficiency.
- **Type IV (Fully Composite Tanks)**
  Fully composite tanks are the lightest and safest, used for high-pressure hydrogen storage. They are primarily used in the automotive industry for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

**By Material**

- **Steel**
  Steel is used in the manufacturing of traditional hydrogen tanks due to its durability and affordability. However, it is heavier compared to composite materials.
